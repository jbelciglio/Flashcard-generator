HOW THE CARDS WORK
Basic Card: The Basic Card goes by question and answer. In the first prompt, you will type in your question. 
Then in the next prompt, type in your answer. It will be stored in the Basic Card file.

Cloze Card: The Cloze Cards are ones that are sentences missing a crucial piece. First, fill out the beginning part of your sentence.
Then, type in the hidden part.
